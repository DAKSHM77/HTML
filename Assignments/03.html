    <h4>Japan is an island country in the North Pacific Ocean. It lies off the northeast coast of mainland Asia and
        faces Russia,Korea, and China. Four large islands and thousands of smaller ones make up Japan. The four major
        islands-

        Hokkaido,Honshu,Kyushu and Shikoku form a curve that extends for about 1,900 kilometres. Topography



        Japan is a land of great natural beauty. mountains and hills cover about 70% of the country. IN fact, Japanese
        islands consist of the rugged upper part of a great mountain range that rises from the floor of the North
        Pacific Ocean.

        Jagged peaks, rocky gorges, and thundering mountain waterfalls provide some of the country's most spectacular
        scenery.</h4>
